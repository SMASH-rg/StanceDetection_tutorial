# StanceDetection_tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with stance detection modeling using supervised and unsupervised algorithms. This tutorial contains snippets of scripts that will give you a preliminary idea of how to explore the dataset, train stance detection model on an annotated data.

##  Data exploration:
 You can use subset of Trump dataset [1] from *Dataset* folder. This data contains around 4200 rows labeled with [pro and anti] stance. The training and testing file can be accessed from *Dataset* folder.

## Supervised stance detection:
 You can use the script in simple_supervised_model.py to train model using content and network features.
