# StanceDetection_tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with stance detection modeling using supervised and unsupervised algorithms. This tutorial contains snippets of scripts that will give you a preliminary idea of how to explore the dataset, run the scrip on the subset of the data.

This lab will walk you through the main basic steps to build a stance detection model. To start with this tutorial, you will:

##  Data preparation:
 You can use subset of Trump dataset [1] from Daatsetfolder. This data contains around 4000 rows labeled with pro, anti stance. 

## Supervised stance detection
 You can use the script in simple_supervised_model.py to train model using content and network features.
